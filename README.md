# RepoStatus

Displays the status of each branch in a GitHub repository. Check out [RepoStatus.io](https://repostatus.io).

## To do

The current status of this project is: garbage. It might be better after I do some more stuff, like:

- [ ] Fix WebSocket server
- [ ] Rename Travis package
- [ ] Better logging
- [ ] Config system (GHAT)
- [ ] Index page
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Actually get all of the branches
- [ ] Clean up branch status cards
- [ ] Link to useful things (branch, PRs, status checks, etc.)
- [ ] Handle errors properly (e.g. a bad repo slug appears to load forever)
- [ ] Sorting should occur client side
- [ ] Put frontend dependencies in /static
- [ ] Reorganize JS and CSS
