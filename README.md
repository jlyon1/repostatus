# RepoStatus

Displays the status of each branch in a GitHub repository.

## To do

The current status of this repo is: garbage. It might be better after I do some more stuff, like:

- [ ] Fix WebSocket server
- [ ] Rename Travis package
- [ ] Better logging
- [ ] Config system
- [ ] Index page
- [ ] Docs
- [ ] Tests
